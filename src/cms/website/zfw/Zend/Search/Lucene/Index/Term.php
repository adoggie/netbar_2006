/**
 * A Term represents a word from text.  This is the unit of search.  It is
 * composed of two elements, the text of the word, as a string, and the name of
 * the field that the text occured in, an interned string.
 *
 * Note that terms may represent more than words from text fields, but also
 * things like dates, email addresses, urls, etc.
