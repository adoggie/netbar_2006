@todo

- Improve API: fix ZSearchMultiTermQuery($terms, $signs);

- Analysis and indexing engine

- Additional queries: phrase, wildcard, proximity, and range

- Better class-level docblocks (most functions okay)

- Some Windows issues(?) during indexing

- Finish renaming classes to PEAR-like conventions
